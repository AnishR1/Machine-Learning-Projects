# Machine Learning Models 

### Boston Housing Data
The .ipynb files contain the machinne learning models and the predictive analysis of a part of Boston housing data.

### Classification of Patients with stroke
The .Rmd files contain an R project which has the dataset and analysis from patient stroke predictions available on kaggle. This tries various machine-learning algorithms and gives the best algorithm to predict the stroke probabibility in patients.
